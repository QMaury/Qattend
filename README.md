# Qattend (alpha version 1.0)
a simple program to keep track of students Qattendance written in POSIX shell.

# How it works
there's a text file in the same directory as the executable binary, that contains all the student's names.
the program then reads the text file, and asks you which students are present.
after the list is finished being read, the program will spit out the total of students present and absent.


# Warning! This program is worse than gay old men sucking each other off
this program is unfinished, and incredibly fucking retarded.
this is mainly just practice with POSIX shell. I'm not a teacher, or anyone who needs a program like this. literally just bored.

If by some odd coincidence you come across this, and actually need a program like this, you'd better wait til its in a more finished state.


like, you dont understand this program is actually fucking stupid. if you want to use it in its current state you gotta go into the source code and change shit around.
gimme a couple days til I finish it more.
